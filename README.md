## Problem Statement

The Electric Vehicles Power BI Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to provide insights into the EV market and individual vehicle performance. This dashboard integrates various data sources to present a holistic view of the electric vehicle landscape through interactive visualizations and detailed analytics.

### Key features include:

Market Analysis: Visualize trends in EV adoption, market share by manufacturer, and sales growth over time. Understand the geographic distribution of EVs and identify leading markets.

Battery Performance: Track battery health and efficiency metrics, including charge cycles, capacity degradation over time, and range per charge. Compare the performance of different battery technologies and manufacturers.

Charging Infrastructure: Analyze the availability and utilization of charging stations. Visuals show the distribution of charging stations, average charging times, and peak usage periods, helping to identify gaps in the infrastructure.

Environmental Impact: Assess the environmental benefits of EVs by comparing emissions reductions relative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Display metrics such as CO2 emissions saved, fuel savings, and overall energy consumption.

Vehicle Usage Patterns: Examine driving behaviors and usage patterns, including average trip lengths, frequency of use, and time-of-day usage. This data helps in understanding how EVs are being utilized by different user segments.

Financial Metrics: Evaluate the total cost of ownership for EVs versus traditional vehicles, incorporating factors like purchase price, maintenance costs, fuel savings, and government incentives.

Customer Feedback and Satisfaction: Gather and display customer satisfaction ratings, feedback, and common issues reported. This helps manufacturers and service providers improve their offerings.

Predictive Analytics: Use historical data to forecast future trends in EV adoption, battery life expectancy, and potential market disruptions. This allows stakeholders to make informed strategic decisions.

By leveraging the Electric Vehicles Power BI Dashboard, stakeholders such as manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers can gain valuable insights, drive strategic initiatives, and contribute to the sustainable growth of the electric vehicle market.
